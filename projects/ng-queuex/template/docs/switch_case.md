# QueuexSwitchCase class

## Selector: `'ng-template[qxSwitchCase]'`

## Description

`QueuexSwitchCase` (`*qxSwitchCase`) is a companion structural directive to  `QueuexSwitch` (`[qxSwitch]`). It defines a template block that is rendered when the bound `qxSwitch` expression matches the provided case value.

Each case view created by this directive is:
 - **Lazily instantiated** through the concurrent scheduler from `ng-queuex/core`.
 - **Detached from Angular‚Äôs logical tree**, so it is not affected by the host component‚Äôs change detection cycle.
 - Given its own **isolated reactive context**, which allows signals read directly in the template to trigger local, fine-grained change detection.

When the parent `[qxSwitch]` value changes, `QueuexSwitchCase` views are efficiently  scheduled and activated or destroyed depending on whether their case matches.

## Server side fallback
During server-side rendering, `QueuexSwitchCase` falls back to the behavior of  Angular‚Äôs native `NgSwitchCase`. Views are instantiated
synchronously and remain part of the standard logical view tree. No detachment, no isolated reactive contexts, and no scheduling are applied ‚Äî ensuring clean, fast, and predictable SSR output.

## Example
```html
<div [qxSwitch]="status">
  <p *qxSwitchCase="'loading'">Loading‚Ä¶</p>
  <p *qxSwitchCase="'success'">Data loaded ‚úÖ</p>
  <p *qxSwitchCase="'error'">Something went wrong ‚ùå</p>
  <p *qxSwitchDefault>Unknown state ü§î</p>
</div>
 ```
